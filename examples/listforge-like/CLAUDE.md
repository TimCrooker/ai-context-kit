# Claude Instructions

This file is generated from `.ai/context/scopes.json` by `ai-context build`.
Edit scope definitions and re-run the build instead of editing this file directly.

## Shared Canonical Context (Inlined)

<!-- Source: .ai/context/modules/*.md -->
# Example Agent Context

This canonical context is generated from modular files.

## Product Context

This fixture models a multi-app commerce workflow.

## Claude-Specific Notes

- Use scoped `CLAUDE.md` files for domain-specific, just-in-time context.
- Reserve `.claude/rules/*.md` for narrow path-glob injections only.
- Keep local secrets in `.ai/secrets.local.env` (gitignored).
